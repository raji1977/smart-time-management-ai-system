# 🧠 Smart Time Management System (AI-Driven Multi-Agent Productivity App)

An **AI-powered multi-agent system** built with **Python, Flask, and Mesa**, designed to simulate intelligent task scheduling, prioritization, and productivity tracking.  
This project integrates **five autonomous agents** — each representing a cognitive function such as scheduling, optimization, reminders, focus monitoring, and reporting.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **Smart Time Management System** uses a **multi-agent architecture** to intelligently plan and monitor daily tasks.  
Each agent interacts dynamically to manage time more effectively — similar to a team of digital assistants working together.

It includes:
- A **Flask-based dashboard** with real-time charts and task analytics.
- An **agent-driven logic layer** that mimics human-like productivity behavior.
- A foundation for **machine learning–based adaptive optimization**.

## 🧩 AI & Multi-Agent Components

| Agent | Function | AI Concept |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| 🗓️ **SchedulerAgent** | Assigns tasks to optimal time slots | Rule-based reasoning |
| ⚙️ **TaskOptimizerAgent** | Re-prioritizes tasks based on efficiency | Adaptive heuristic learning |
| 🔔 **ReminderAgent** | Generates smart reminders before deadlines | Temporal logic |
| 🎯 **FocusMonitorAgent** | Tracks task progress and focus data | Data-driven behavior |
| 📊 **ReportGeneratorAgent** | Summarizes performance metrics | Analytical insight generation |

> Together, these agents represent a **distributed AI system** that simulates intelligent decision-making and coordination.
